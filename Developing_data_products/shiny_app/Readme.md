This Shiny application predicts a child's adult height using the following formula given by Dr. Jay L. Hoecker in his answer to [What's the best way to predict a child's adult height?](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/expert-answers/child-growth/faq-20057990) on the [Mayo Clinic web site](http://www.mayoclinic.org/):

* Add the mother's height and the father's height in either inches or centimeters.
* Add 5 inches (13 centimeters) for boys or subtract 5 inches (13 centimeters) for girls.
* Divide by two.


On the left, choose from the tabs "US Units" and "Metric Units", move the sliders to enter mother's and father's height, and select gender of the child. On the right, user inputs are echoed and prediction of child's height is printed.

Whenever any input value changes, the prediction and echoed input value are updated automatically.
